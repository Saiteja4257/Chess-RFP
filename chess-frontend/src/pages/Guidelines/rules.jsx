            Each player has a set amount of time to make their moves. If time
            runs out, they lose the game, regardless of the position on the
            board.

            The game begins with the standard chess setup, with each player
            controlling 16 pieces, including pawns, rooks, knights, bishops,
            queens, and the king.

          <p>
            Moves that violate the rules of chess, such as moving a piece out of
            turn or moving a piece to an illegal square, are not allowed. The
            opponent may challenge illegal moves.

            className="item-icon"
          />
          <p>
            Draws can occur through stalemate, insufficient material, or
            agreement between the players. A draw may also be claimed after a
            threefold repetition or 50 moves without a pawn move or capture.

            alt="Resignation"
            className="item-icon"
          />
          <p>
            If a player believes they have no chance of winning, they may choose
            to resign. This ends the game and awards the victory to the
            opponent.

          <h3>Checkmate</h3>

            alt="Checkmate"
            className="item-icon"
          />
          <p>
            The game ends in checkmate when a player’s king is under attack and
            there is no legal move to remove the threat. The player whose king
            is checkmated loses the game.
