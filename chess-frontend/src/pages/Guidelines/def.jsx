          />
          <p>
            Sometimes, blocking the opponent's attacks by placing a piece in the
            line of fire is a good defensive tactic.

            alt="Retreating to Safety"
            className="item-icon"
          />
          <p>
            When faced with a dangerous attack, it’s often better to retreat a
            piece to a safe square rather than losing it.

          <p>

            opponent's weaknesses to shift the momentum in your favor.
