            Each player sets up their pieces on the two rows closest to them.
            The back row holds the pieces: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king,
            bishop, knight, and rook in this order.

          <p>
            Place the pawns in the second row (row 2 for white and row 7 for
            black). The pawns form a barrier in front of the other pieces at the
            start of the game.

          <p>
            Make sure the board is oriented correctly: the bottom-right square
            should always be a light-colored square. Each player should have a
            white square on the right-hand corner.

            The white pieces are always placed on the first two rows and the
            black pieces on the last two. The player with the white pieces
            always moves first.
